Normal forms are a set of rules or guidelines used in database design to minimize data redundancy and dependency, ensuring data integrity and improving database efficiency. These rules help organize data in relational databases to reduce anomalies and inconsistencies. There are several normal forms, each building upon the principles of the preceding one:

**First Normal Form (1NF):**

Each table cell should contain a single value, and each column should contain data of the same type.
Eliminates repeating groups within a table by breaking them into separate tables.

**Second Normal Form (2NF):**

Every non-prime attribute (attributes not part of any candidate key) must be fully functionally dependent on the entire primary key.
Requires 1NF and eliminates partial dependencies by removing columns that are dependent on only part of the primary key, moving them to separate tables if necessary.

**Third Normal Form (3NF):**

Every non-prime attribute must be non-transitively dependent on the primary key.
Requires 2NF and eliminates transitive dependencies by removing columns that depend on other non-key columns.

**Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF):**

A stronger form of 3NF where every determinant (attribute on which another attribute is fully functionally dependent) is a candidate key.
Ensures that there are no non-trivial functional dependencies where a determinant is not a candidate key.

**Fourth Normal Form (4NF):**

Introduces the concept of multi-valued dependencies and ensures that there are no non-trivial multi-valued dependencies between attributes.
Helps further reduce redundancy by splitting multi-valued attributes into separate tables.

**Fifth Normal Form (5NF):**

Addresses cases where a table contains multiple overlapping candidate keys.
Ensures that every join dependency in the table is implied by the candidate keys.
Each normal form represents a higher level of normalization, with the higher forms aiming to eliminate more types of data redundancy and dependency. However, achieving higher normal forms may result in more complex database schemas and may not always be necessary depending on the specific requirements of the application. It's essential to strike a balance between normalization and practicality in database design.
